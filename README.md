# Exploring-Python
Repository dedicated to storing code I've written while trying to advance my skills in Python 2 and 3.
It includes both familiarizing with the standard Python library + Functions as well as other popular libraries for python.
Mostly done in Python 3 but some scripts are for Python 2 (Eg. Everything PyQt4)
I tried to comment the code out as best as possible so if I need to refer back to it in the future I won't hate myself.
